# First-Report Review (Child Safety, Harassment)
#
# Flags child_safety and harassment reports for HUMAN REVIEW on the FIRST report of
# an event, from ANY reporter (NOT gated to trusted reporters). These categories only
# emit flag_for_review -- a moderator triages in the dedicated Coop queue (Child
# Safety, Harassment); no automatic enforcement. Modeled on FirstSexualReport in
# multi_report_threshold.sml.
#
# WHY NOT trusted-reporter-gated: "trusted reporter" today is a hardcoded list of two
# system identities (admin + the moderation-service), seeded manually
# (divine/scripts/seed-trusted-reporters.sh). Gating these categories on it would mean
# ordinary users' child-safety / harassment reports never surface via Osprey. nudity
# and violence already surface on any user's first report; these match that, since the
# only action is flag_for_review (a human still decides). The trusted-reporter gate is
# reserved for AUTOMATIC actions (the CSAM/NSFW auto-hide in auto_hide.sml). An evolved
# trust model is roadmapped (support-trust-safety/docs/moderation/coop-osprey-future-lifts-roadmap.md).
#
# The <reason>_reported label dedups: the first report flags + labels the event, so a
# second report of the same category on the same event does not re-flag. human_reviewed
# suppresses re-flagging content a moderator has already handled.
#
# LIMITATION: keyed on ReportedEventId, so this only covers content (event) reports, not
# user-only reports (a p-tag with no e-tag) -- same as the existing nudity/violence
# rules. User-targeted reports (e.g. underage accounts) go via the relay-manager path.
#
# Report reasons are normalized by the bridge (childSafety -> child_safety, etc.).
# NB each Rule name below becomes a ClickHouse column (clickhouse-schema/001_osprey_events.sql).
